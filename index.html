             <h2>I am a<br> full stack developer</h2>
        </div>
        I am  a mid-twenties Kenyan geek who one day aspires to be a
         <em>techpreneur/software solutions developer.</em> Computers have always fascinated me ever since I was young,be it in solving scientific problems, 
         running basic calculations or even just playing video games. Programming has really got to be one of the most interesting things to dwell in nowadays, 
         one gets to come up with <span style="color: blue;"> algorithm</span> to solve problems, run operations or even get a product out of a production process. 
         Learning how to code not only gives me new ideas on how to 
         solve things but it also helps me be creative when coming up with ideas.  In the modern world
         we're living in it means that better opportunities lie ahead in programming.
         The main reason why I joined Moringa is to widen my skill-set and hopefully
         land a job after the programme.
